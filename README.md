# Churn Risk Explainer — GPT + SHAP + Streamlit

This AI-powered app predicts **customer churn risk** and explains it using **plain English**, powered by SHAP + OpenAI GPT (3.5/4).

Perfect for CX, retention, and data science teams who need more than black-box predictions — they need **narratives that drive action**.

---

## Productisation Ready

This app is designed to evolve beyond a demo. Here's how it's **ready for production**:

- **Modular codebase** — Easy to wrap in Flask, deploy via Docker, or integrate into a customer service dashboard.
- **Explainable AI** — Transparent feature-level reasoning via SHAP, ready for compliance-heavy industries (telco, banking, insurance).
- **Pluggable Output** — Export churn reports as PDFs, email them to account managers, or log them into CRM systems.
- **LLM Swap Option** — Use GPT-4, Claude, or local LLMs by toggling one variable.
- **Log + Audit Trail** — Every explanation is timestamped and logged for internal review or analyst re-use.
- **Hugging Face Deployable** — Hosted UX in minutes, no infra needed.
- **Upcoming**: evaluation dashboards, email workflows, CSV batch explainers, multi-user mode.

If you're a business or consultancy working with churn, **this tool can go from prototype to pilot in under a week**.
